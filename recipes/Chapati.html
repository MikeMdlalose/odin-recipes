	<li>250g plain flour</li> 
	<li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li> 
	<li>3 tbsp butter (optional)</li> 
  </ul>
 <h3> Steps</h3>

   <li><p>Mix the flours, 1 tsp of fine sea salt and oil in a large bowl. Add 250ml of water and knead until the dough comes together in the bowl. Knead on a lightly floured worksurface until smooth, then divide into 15 balls. Roll out to flat discs approximately 15cm wide.</p>  </li>
   <li><p>Heat a tava or non-stick frying pan over a high heat and cook the chapatis, one at a time, for 30 seconds until blistered and golden brown.
