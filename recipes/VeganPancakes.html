  <h3> Description </h3>
  <p>These vegan pancakes are light, fluffy, and delicious. I have been making them for years, and everyone that tries them wants the recipe.</p>
  <p>Serve these chocolate treats warm with a sprinkling of powdered sugar or fresh strawberries. </p>
  <h3> Ingredients </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> 1¼ cups all-purpose flour </li>
	<li> 1¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
	<li> 3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
	<li> ¼ teaspoon salt </li>
	<li> 2 eggs, at room temperature </li>
	<li> 1¼ cups milk </li>
	<li> ½ teaspoon vanilla </li>
	<li> 2 tablespoons melted butter </li>
	<li> ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips </li>	
  </ul>
 <h3> Steps</h3>
 <ol>
   <li><p>Whisk flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat eggs, milk, and vanilla in another bowl; mix in the melted butter. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and mix just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</p>  </li>
   <li><p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter on griddle and cook until bubbles pop in the center of the pancake, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook an additional minute on the opposite side.</p>  </li>
   <li> <p>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip, then cook until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</p> </li>	
 </ol>
